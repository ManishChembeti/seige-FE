        <p>This military vehicle was initially named Hummer. By 1998, the name changed to Humvee. See also Hummer (2002). This casting has always been made in plastic, with a metal base and has been modified (retooled) several times. Original versions has a turret-mounted high-caliber machine gun. Later versions removed the turret but kept the rear opening hatch. The latest mainline releases deleted the opening hatch.

          The US Army HMMWV (High Mobility and Maneuverability Wheeled Vehicle), from which the colloquial "Humvee is derived, was fielded in 1986-88 and participated on its first combat mission in Operation Just Cause (Panama) in 1989.
